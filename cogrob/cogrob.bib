  abstract     = {We present an efficient and scalable algorithm for segmenting 3D RGBD point clouds by combining depth, color, and temporal information using a multistage, hierarchical graph-based approach. Our algorithm processes a moving window over several point clouds to group similar regions over a graph, resulting in an initial over-segmentation. These regions are then merged to yield a dendrogram using agglomerative clustering via a minimum spanning tree algorithm. Bipartite graph matching at a given level of the hierarchical tree yields the final segmentation of the point clouds by maintaining region identities over arbitrarily long periods of time. We show that a multistage segmentation with depth then color yields better results than a linear combination of depth and color. Due to its incremental processing, our algorithm can process videos of any length and in a streaming pipeline. The algorithm's ability to produce robust, efficient segmentation is demonstrated with numerous experimental results on challenging sequences from our own as well as public RGBD data sets.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present an object pose estimation algorithm exploiting both depth and color information. While many approaches assume that a target region is cleanly segmented from background, our approach does not rely on that assumption, and thus it can estimate pose of a target object in heavy clutter. Recently, an oriented point pair feature was introduced as a low dimensional description of object surfaces. The feature has been employed in a voting scheme to find a set of possible 3D rigid transformations between object model and test scene features. While several approaches using the pair features require an accurate 3D CAD model as training data, our approach only relies on several scanned views of a target object, and hence it is straightforward to learn new objects. In addition, we argue that exploiting color information significantly enhances the performance of the voting process in terms of both time and accuracy. To exploit the color information, we define a color point pair feature, which is employed in a voting scheme for more effective pose estimation. We show extensive quantitative results of comparative experiments between our approach and a state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {We present a 3D model-based visual tracking approach using edge and keypoint features in a particle filtering framework. Recently, particle-filtering-based approaches have been proposed to integrate multiple pose hypotheses and have shown good performance, but most of the work has made an assumption that an initial pose is given. To ameliorate this limitation, we employ keypoint features for initialization of the filter. Given 2Dâ€“3D keypoint correspondences, we randomly choose a set of minimum correspondences to calculate a set of possible pose hypotheses. Based on the inlier ratio of correspondences, the set of poses are drawn to initialize particles. After the initialization, edge points are employed to estimate inter-frame motions. While we follow a standard edge-based tracking, we perform a refinement process to improve the edge correspondences between sampled model edge points and image edge points. For better tracking performance, we employ a first-order autoregressive state dynamics, which propagates particles more effectively than Gaussian random walk models. The proposed system re-initializes particles by itself when the tracked object goes out of the field of view or is occluded. The robustness and accuracy of our approach is demonstrated using comparative experiments on synthetic and real image sequences.},

Our approach detects several types of edges, and makes use of both 3D shape information and photometric texture information. Edges are categorized as occluding edges, occluded edges, boundary edges, high-curvature edges, and RGB edges. We exploit the organized structure of the RGB-D image to efficiently detect edges, enabling near real-time performance. We present two applications of these edge features: edge-based pair-wise registration and a pose-graph SLAM approach based on this registration, which we compare to state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of edge detection and edge-based registration both quantitatively and qualitatively.},

The literature includes a variety of SLAM approaches targeted at different environments, platforms, sensors, CPU budgets, and applications. We propose OmniMapper, a modular multimodal framework and toolbox for solving SLAM problems. The system can be used to generate pose graphs, do feature-based SLAM, and also includes tools for semantic mapping. Multiple measurement types from different sensors can be combined for multimodal mapping. It is open with standard interfaces to allow easy integration of new sensors and feature types. We present a detailed description of the mapping approach, as well as a software framework that implements this, and present detailed descriptions of its applications to several domains including mapping with a service robot in an indoor environment, large-scale mapping on a PackBot, and mapping with a handheld RGBD camera.},
